# PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS-ANZ
## Overview
This analysis aims to estimate the annual salary for customers using transaction data, explore correlations between salary and customer attributes, and build predictive models. The process involves aggregating transaction amounts to estimate annual salaries and deriving additional features like total transaction amount, average transaction amount, and transaction count. Correlation analysis and scatter plots are used to identify relationships between salary and attributes like age. A linear regression model and a decision-tree model are then built and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) scores. The regression model's R^2 score indicates moderate accuracy, while the decision-tree model performs similarly. Based on these results, ANZ can consider using these models for customer segmentation, though further refinement and validation may be necessary for reliable segmentation.
## Business Problem
ANZ Bank aims to enhance its customer segmentation strategy to provide personalized financial products and services but lacks detailed income data for many customers. This limitation affects the bank's ability to target high-value customers with premium services, optimize credit risk assessments, and improve marketing strategies. The objective is to develop a predictive model to estimate customers' annual incomes based on transaction data and other attributes. This model will enable ANZ to segment customers into income brackets more accurately, allowing for tailored product offerings, optimized marketing efforts, improved customer satisfaction, and better credit risk management. By doing so, ANZ Bank seeks to strengthen customer relationships, increase competitive advantage, and drive revenue growth.
## Dataset
The Dataset that was given to us is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions. The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights we will gather will be genuine. The dataset contains 100 unique accounts. 12043 transactions and 23 features.

## Conclusion
Based on the features selected and the models, it can be concluded that the Linear Regresion model performed better than the Decision Tree model as it's mse is lower and it's R2 value is more acceptable. The test case for Linear regression model predicted a more acceptable value as well. However, both models' performace are arbitrary and the features may be biased. I personally think that better features can be selected and a more suitable model can be chosen.
